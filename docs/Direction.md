# How to play Direction :point_left:

## The objective of this game is to guess which direction your opponent will be pointing, during your turn.<br><br/>

### **Here is how you play:**
1. Decide who goes first
3. Tap twice on blue button to start every round
3. Either swipe up, down, left or right immediately after Step 2
4. Wojak's direction is displayed inside the box. If he points to the direction that you swiped, you win the round!
5. If he did not point at the direction that you swiped, that's the end of your turn!
6. Tap twice again and swipe on a direction
7. If you swiped to a direction that Wojak pointed to, you lose the round!
Otherwise, it's your turn again. Good luck!

Every correct guess is 1 point.
