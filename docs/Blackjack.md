# How to play Blackjack :black_joker:

## This is a subvariant of Blackjack, also known as [Ban-Luck](https://blog.seedly.sg/cny-games-guide/)
<sub>Please note that Ban-Luck, the Chinese Blackjack, has some standard rules, but unusual house rules are common. Kindly seek your understanding on how I set up this game.</sub><br><br/>

### **Here is how you play:**
1. Decide who goes first
2. Each player gets to draw cards using the "Hit" button during their turn
3. Once player is comfy with their hand, click on the "Stand" button
4. If you were served an Ace and a Ten/Picture, you got blackjack!
5. Getting blackjack is an instant win!
6. If Wojak has a higher hand than you that's within 21, you lose the round.
7. Otherwise, you win the round! Good luck, anon!
